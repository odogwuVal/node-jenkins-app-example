# Deployment strategy
This is a very basic node js application that displays "Hello world"

A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle via automation. 

By automating CI/CD throughout development, testing, production, and monitoring phases of the software development lifecycle, organizations are able to develop higher quality code, faster. Although itâ€™s possible to manually execute each of the steps of a CI/CD pipeline, the true value of CI/CD pipelines is realized through automation.

I have created a CI/CD pipeline using github action because of its seamingly simplicity with regards to our use case.
The deployment phase involvs packaging the aplication in a docker image and deploying using docker-compose.
I have leveraged Github environments to dynamically require manual approval for deployment to production.
When a change is made to the dev branch, the entire process is automated but a change to the master branch will require a manual approval for deployment to occur

I have also implemented a script that checks the status of the container to see if it is in a running state and rollback if it isn't

```bash
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i private_key ${USER_NAME}@${HOSTNAME} '
          sleep 180
          result=$( docker inspect -f {{.State.Running}} } seamlesshr)
          echo $result
          if [$result == "true"]
          then
            echo "rollout is successful"
          else
            sed -i.back "/image:/s/${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\/seamlesshr:.*/${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}\/seamlesshr:env.GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER_WITH_OFFSET/g" docker-compose.yaml
            docker-compose up -d
            echo "rollback to previous version complete"
          fi
        '
```
