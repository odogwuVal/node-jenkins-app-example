# Deployment strategy
This is a very basic node js application that displays "Hello world"

A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle via automation. 

By automating CI/CD throughout development, testing, production, and monitoring phases of the software development lifecycle, organizations are able to develop higher quality code, faster. Although itâ€™s possible to manually execute each of the steps of a CI/CD pipeline, the true value of CI/CD pipelines is realized through automation.

I have created a CI/CD pipeline using github action because of its seamingly simplicity with regards to our use case.
The deployment phase involvs packaging the aplication in a docker image and deploying using docker-compose.
I have leveraged Github environments to dynamically require manual approval for deployment to production.
When a change is made to the dev branch, the entire process is automated but a change to the master branch will require a manual approval for deployment to occur
